# HTMLAssessment

### Description

Simple page with correctly structured HTML document skeleton, including a document title. Added elements with their respective section headers, demonstrating knowledge of basic HTML markup.


### Lessons Learned
I haven't made HTML tables since the 10th grade. It was useful going through this exercise. I setup git before this course on this computer. The local git account differs from the remote so I'm having a confict there. This has not been an issue before because we initialized the repo at github.com and then cloned it down to local. I missed Friday afternoon's class so I am going to push what I have now the way I know how to do it. Tomorrow, I will try and mess with the config on local so that I can git init from local, set the remote, and push from local without the need to setup on github first.
